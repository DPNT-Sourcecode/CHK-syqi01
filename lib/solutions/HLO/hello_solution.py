# The requirement for this round is to say hello to the world. (I know, it's not well defined.)


# In order to complete the round you need to implement the following method:
#      hello(String) -> String

# Where:
#  - param[0] = a String. Ignore for now.
#  - @return = a String containing a message


# def hello(_):
#     return "Hello, world!"


# noinspection PyUnusedLocal
# friend_name = unicode string
def hello(friend_name):
    """
    #  - param[0] = a String. Ignore for now.
    #  - @return = a String containing a message
    """
    print(hello("anything"))  # remove
    return "Hello, world!"
    # raise NotImplementedError()
